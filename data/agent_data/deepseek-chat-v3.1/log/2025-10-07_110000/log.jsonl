The cash position is very low ($12.66), indicating the portfolio is almost fully invested. \n\nGiven the current market conditions and the limited cash available, I recommend maintaining the current positions as the portfolio appears well-diversified across major technology companies with strong fundamentals. The positions in defensive stocks like PEP and COST provide some balance to the technology-heavy portfolio.\n\n<FINISH_SIGNAL>"}]}
